# Test Results - Permission System & Standby Crew Restrictions

## Current Testing Focus
1. **Standby Crew Permission Restriction:** Verify that users with `ship=Standby` and `role=viewer/editor` CANNOT view Crew List or Crew Certificates

## Test Credentials
- **Standby User:** Crew3 / standby123 (role: viewer, ship: Standby)
- **System Admin:** system_admin / YourSecure@Pass2024 (full access)

## Test Scenarios

### 1. JavaScript Error Fix Test
- Login as system_admin / YourSecure@Pass2024
- Navigate to ISM-ISPS-MLC page
- Select a ship (e.g., VINASHIP HARMONY)
- Click on "Audit Report" submenu
- Right-click on any row in the table
- **Expected:** Context menu appears WITHOUT any console errors
- **Check:** No `ReferenceError: setSelectedReports is not defined`

### 2. Permission Denial Test for Crewing
- Login as Crewing / Crewing123
- Navigate to ISM-ISPS-MLC page
- Select a ship (e.g., VINASHIP HARMONY)  
- Click on "Audit Report" submenu
- Try to delete a report via right-click menu
- **Expected:** Vietnamese error message displayed: "Department của bạn không có quyền quản lý loại tài liệu này"

## Backend API Test Results (Already Verified)
- ✅ DELETE /api/audit-reports/{id} - Returns 403 with Vietnamese message
- ✅ POST /api/audit-reports/bulk-delete - Returns 403 with Vietnamese message

## Frontend UI Test Results (Testing Agent - December 17, 2025)

### ✅ TEST 1: JavaScript Error Fix - PASSED
**Status:** SUCCESSFUL
**Tested by:** Testing Agent using Playwright automation
**Date:** December 17, 2025

**Test Steps Performed:**
1. ✅ Successfully logged in as system_admin / YourSecure@Pass2024
2. ✅ Navigated to ISM-ISPS-MLC page via sidebar menu
3. ✅ Selected ship "VINASHIP HARMONY" from ship grid
4. ✅ Clicked on "Audit Report" submenu tab
5. ✅ Performed right-click operation on audit report table row
6. ✅ Monitored console logs during right-click operation

**Results:**
- ✅ **NO JavaScript errors detected** during right-click operation
- ✅ **NO `setSelectedReports is not defined` error** found in console logs
- ✅ Right-click functionality working without throwing errors
- ✅ Audit Report table loaded successfully with "ISPS Code Audit Plan" entry
- ✅ JavaScript fix appears to be working correctly

**Console Log Analysis:**
- Only standard React DevTools and application logs detected
- No error-level console messages during right-click test
- No references to `setSelectedReports` function errors

### ⚠️ TEST 2: Permission Denial Test - NEEDS INVESTIGATION
**Status:** INCONCLUSIVE - Permission system may need frontend implementation
**Tested by:** Testing Agent using Playwright automation
**Date:** December 17, 2025

**Test Steps Performed:**
1. ✅ Successfully logged in as Crewing / Crewing123
2. ✅ Navigated to ISM-ISPS-MLC page via sidebar menu  
3. ✅ Selected ship "VINASHIP HARMONY" from ship grid
4. ✅ Clicked on "Audit Report" submenu tab
5. ✅ Audit Report page loaded with same data as system_admin
6. ⚠️ Right-clicked on audit report table row
7. ❌ No context menu appeared or Delete option was not visible
8. ❌ No Vietnamese permission error message displayed

**Findings:**
- ✅ Crewing user can access ISM-ISPS-MLC page and view audit reports
- ✅ Backend API returns 403 errors (already verified)
- ❌ Frontend context menu may not be implemented or visible for Crewing user
- ❌ Vietnamese permission error message not displayed in UI
- ⚠️ Console shows 403 errors for AI config (expected for Crewing user)

**Possible Issues:**
1. Context menu may not appear for users without permissions (by design)
2. Permission error message may only show when actual delete API is called
3. Frontend may need additional implementation to show permission errors
4. Delete functionality may be hidden/disabled for unauthorized users

## Notes
- Crewing user credentials: username=Crewing, password=Crewing123
- Crewing department: ['ship_crew', 'crewing'] - does NOT have access to ISM-ISPS-MLC
- Test on ship: VINASHIP HARMONY (company matches Crewing)
- Backend permission system working correctly (403 responses verified)
- Frontend JavaScript fix successful - no setSelectedReports errors

## ✅ TEST 3: Standby Crew Permission Restriction Feature
**Status:** PASSED
**Tested by:** Testing Agent using Backend API Tests
**Date:** December 19, 2025

### Test Objective
Verify that users with `ship=Standby` CANNOT view:
1. Crew List (/api/crew)
2. Crew Certificates (/api/crew-certificates and /api/crew-certificates/all)

### Test Credentials Used
- **Standby User:** Crew3 / standby123 (role: viewer, ship: Standby)  
- **System Admin:** system_admin / YourSecure@Pass2024 (full access for comparison)

### API Endpoints Tested
1. `GET /api/crew` - Crew list
2. `GET /api/crew-certificates` - Crew certificates with filters
3. `GET /api/crew-certificates/all` - All crew certificates

### ✅ Test Results - ALL PASSED (4/4 - 100%)

#### Standby User (Crew3) Tests:
1. ✅ **GET /api/crew** - Returns empty array `[]` (count: 0) ✓
2. ✅ **GET /api/crew-certificates** - Returns empty array `[]` (count: 0) ✓
3. ✅ **GET /api/crew-certificates/all** - Returns empty array `[]` (count: 0) ✓

#### System Admin Comparison Test:
4. ✅ **All endpoints** - Returns data (count > 0) ✓

### Key Findings:
- ✅ Standby users correctly blocked from viewing crew data
- ✅ System admin retains full access
- ✅ All endpoints return empty arrays (not 403 errors) for Standby users
- ✅ No system errors or crashes during testing
- ✅ Permission filtering implemented correctly in backend services

### Technical Implementation Verified:
- ✅ `CrewService.get_all_crew()` - Lines 46-47: Returns `[]` for Standby users
- ✅ `CrewCertificateService.get_all_crew_certificates()` - Lines 262-264: Returns `[]` for Standby users  
- ✅ `CrewCertificateService.get_crew_certificates()` - Lines 297-299: Returns `[]` for Standby users
- ✅ Permission check: `user_ship_name.lower() == 'standby'` working correctly

### Backend Test Results Summary:
```
🔴 STANDBY USER RESTRICTION TESTS: 3/3 passed (100.0%)
🟢 SYSTEM ADMIN ACCESS TESTS: 1/1 passed (100.0%)
📈 OVERALL SUCCESS RATE: 4/4 (100.0%)
```

## TEST 4: User Signature Upload Feature
**Status:** TO BE TESTED
**Date:** December 19, 2025

### Test Scenarios Required:
1. **Backend API Test - Upload Signature**
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/users/{user_id}/signature`
   - File type: PNG/JPG image
   - Expected: Background removed, uploaded to GDrive `COMPANY DOCUMENT/User Signature`
   
2. **Frontend Test - Edit User Modal**
   - Navigate to System Settings > User Management
   - Edit any user
   - Upload signature image
   - Verify signature URL saved and displayed

3. **Edge Case - Missing COMPANY DOCUMENT folder**
   - Should auto-create folder if not exists

### Test Credentials:
- system_admin / YourSecure@Pass2024
- User IDs to test: safety (91495ddc-7bf2-4c2a-b523-a65e77c6b763)

### Expected Behavior:
- Image background should be removed automatically
- File uploaded to Google Drive folder: COMPANY DOCUMENT > User Signature
- User record updated with signature_url and signature_file_id
